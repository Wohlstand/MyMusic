# Old files from my childhood

[English (EN)](README.md) [Русский (RU)](README.RUS.md)

There are files I wrote while I was a child, aproximately between 2006~2008 years.

They are simple, they lack expressiveness. I post them as part of my personal
history so that anyone can learn with from what novice musicians usually starts.
To start writing masterpieces, we always usually start write all the garbage on
which we train, master, develop.

I wrote some of these files from accordion notes, and tried to pick up some by
ear. Somewhere it turned out quite awkward, somewhere approximately fine, and
some of them may sound good.

P.S. Remembering 2007, how my friends described these tunes as boring, "funeral"
(especially "Danube waves"), and that is fair: after all, without the proper
expressiveness, even the dead will rise from the grave beause of this nightmare :grin:.

All these files I give into the public domain, do with and from them what you want.

Among these files there are examples of unsuccessful projects, for example, my
attempt in 2007 to remove the Rio Rita from the original, but the result sounds
somehow lousy. Later on MIDI-ru I found a tune that sounds awesome and
accurate, worthy of respect.

I highly recommend to listen these files via [libADLMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI) with
the FatMan bank (Code 58). I created all of these files on a Windows 98 computer
using Cakewalk Sonar 1.0, 1.02, and 1.3. The computer had a SoundBlaster 16 sound
card, which I loved very much, and thanks to which I loved myself OPL3 chip.

**These files will don't sound norma if you'll play them via Windows default MIDI synthesizer, called as "Microsoft GS".**

# List of files
* [**Катюша**](Katusha.mid) - my very first MIDI file, which I made around the
end of 2006, rewriting it from bayan notes in Cakewalk Sonar 1.0. At that time
I was about 14 years old.
* **Multiple versions of "Прощание славянки"**, made between 2007 and 2008
  * [Very first version](Slav_ver1.mid) captured from the accordion notes
  * [Accordion version](Slav_accordion.mid), like first version
  * [Piano version](Slav_piano.mid), like first versopn (made as a joke, to insert into the
    "Lego LOCO" game to replace the main menu theme).
  * [My first attempt to make drums](Slav_ver2-1.mid), it turned out so-so, to be honest.
  Sounds good only on FatMan-bank for OPL3 chip.
  * [Чуть-чуть улучшенная версия](Slav_ver2-2.mid), but still so-so.
* **Valurile_Dunării**, multiple versions
  * [Accirduin](Valurile_Dun%C4%83rii_accordion.mid), captured from the accordion notes
  * [Orchestra](Valurile_Dun%C4%83rii_orchestra.mid), my attempt to arrange the melody.
  Over time, I had a LOT of variations of this melody and attempts to improve it.
  For it, I simply have to devote a whole folder!
* **Осенний сон**, multiple versions. Captured from an accordion notes, later I tried to motify it
и химичить по разному.
  * [Version 1](Ossennij_son_ver1.mid)
  * [Version 2](Ossennij_son_ver2.mid)
  * [Version 3](Ossennij_son_ver3.mid)
  * [Version 4](Ossennij_son_ver4.mid)
  * [Version 5](Ossennij_son_ver5.mid)
* [**Rio-Ritta**](Rio-Ritta.mid), very bad file, captured by ear from a recording of the 30s
* [**На сопках манчьжурии**](Na_sopkah_manchzhuriji.mid), captured from accordion notes, later arranged
* **Karelo-Finnish polka**, also captured from accordion notes and arranged (P.S. A filename is incorrect because I wrote it incorrectly in 2007'th year)
  * [Version 1](KorelloFinskayapolka_ver1.mid)
  * [Version 2](KorelloFinskayapolka_ver2.mid)
  * [Version 3](KorelloFinskayapolka_ver3.mid)
* **Waltz "Waiting"**, captured from accordion notes
  * [Version 1](Ozhidanie_ver1.mid)
  * [Version 2](Ozhidanie_ver2.mid), an improved version, I don't remind when I had to improve it, it's much later...
* [**Hava-Nagila, version1**](HavaNagila_ver1.mid). It's my first remake. As a basis,
I took a MIDI file that was used on the site "Postcards@mail-ru" (later disappeared
into non-existence) as music for postcards. I really did not like the first version
for its primitiveness, and I decided to improve it.
* [**Hava-Nagila, version2**](HavaNagila_ver1.mid). After "Postcards@mail-ru" updated
their music system, replaced MIDI files with MP3 recordings, there was a version performed
by the James Last Orchestra. I liked it, and already purely for myself, I reworked my MIDI file
so that it was close to this version. The first version I lost, it would seem, was. But I
found it thanks to backups, fuf :smile:.
